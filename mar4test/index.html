			<h3>Nosgoth basic information</h3>

			
				<p><strong>Nosgoth</strong> is a free-to-play multiplayer action-adventure game, <mark>developed by <em>Psyonix</em> and published by Square Enix</mark> for Microsoft Windows through digital distribution. <mark>It is a spin-off of the <em>Legacy of Kain</em></mark> series of action-adventure games, and takes place in their eponymous fictional universe. <b>Nosgoth</b> employs a <abbr title="Player versus Player"><b>PvP</b></abbr> system in which each match consists of two rounds. Teams comprise characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; or humans, whose gameplay is styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulates the most points by fighting their counterparts wins the match.</p>

				
				<p><mark>Initially announced in June 2013</mark> following internet leaks, <b>Nosgoth</b> was the first <em>Legacy of Kain</em>-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's <em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, <em>Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun</em>, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception; criticism focused on its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven <em>Legacy of Kain</em> formula. The game is in open beta as of <strong>January 22nd 2015</strong>.</p>

			<h3>GamePlay</h3>
			
				<p><Strong>Nosgoth</Strong> is an asymmetrical online multiplayer third-person shooter. Nosgoth's gameplay focuses on melee Vampire characters against the ranged Human characters.<mark>Gameplay consists of two modes: Deathmatch in which The Vampires and Humans fight against each other to get a higher kill-count than the opposing team</mark>. If the killcount reaches a threshold, the team that reached it wins. Or time runs out, the team with the higher kills wins, and <mark>Flashpoint: offshoot of traditional Domination modes that tasks Humans with capturing a series of control points in the map</mark>. Two points are initially available, chosen at random, and when one point is captured, another appears. Humans have a limited amount of time to complete their mission, but each successful capture adds time to the clock, extending the match. Vampires win if they can prevent captures long enough for the match timer to run out. <mark>Both team types use a character class-based system</mark>, meaning there are different vampires and humans that have varying different roles. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, as Vampires rely on surprise attacks. Both teams possess abilities, which can be activated having cooldown periods when used, or are passive/innately active. Vampires have the ability to fly and climb buildings, humans are grounded and do not get to experience this trait. The Humans rely on weaponry, and projectile-based ranged attacks, such as crossbows. They have ammunition that can be depleted, which can then be refilled at ammunition stations. Vampires being melee, will have very different ways to attack, such as pouncing on top of a human and clawing at them, making them unable to act as they are knocked down, or being grabbed by a flying-based Vampire and dropped into more Vampires.</p>
